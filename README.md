Welcome to my repository dedicated to documenting my journey through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. In this repository, you'll find Jupyter notebooks organized by chapter, each containing detailed notes, code snippets, and exercises from the book.
